          <p>
            Olivier Rousteing’s tenure at Balmain has lasted a dozen years
            already, but to hear him tell it he’s still “finding confidence”
            with the house. “I live almost every day of my life like a new
            chapter,” the designer offered during a showroom visit.
          </p>
          <p>
            It may ring counterintuitive, but it takes confidence to dive into
            the archives of a designer whose name is now more closely associated
            with Rousteing than it is with a founder’s signature—the kind that,
            decades if not a century on, remains the lifeblood of other heritage
            houses. Mention Pierre Balmain, and few would be able to summon a
            catchphrase like ”jolie madame.”

            Behind the scenes, both Off-White and its parent group New Guards
            have been recently subject to a restructuring of their respective
            executive mastheads. Front of house, meanwhile, the brand that first
            propelled NGG to such powerhouse status continues to develop under
            the creative guidance of Ibrahim Kamara. Last season, Kamara took us
            to the moon (not in a crypto way) via Sierra Leone. In this resort
            collection, he continued to excavate the cultural spaces created by
            the shifting 21st century forces of globalization, the digital
            diaspora, and the gravity of personal identity.

            All week, Wes Gordon was watching the Rio weather like a hawk. The
            Carolina Herrera designer had brought his resort show to the
            Brazilian beach town in a first for the New York label. “Herrera has
            such a strong connection to Latin America, and the idea of Rio just
            felt so mesmerizing and captivating,” he said at a preview in the
            brand’s Seventh Avenue showroom last month. (With a healthy
            fragrance business in Brazil, Rio made for an ideal spot to launch
            and celebrate a new fragrance, too.)
