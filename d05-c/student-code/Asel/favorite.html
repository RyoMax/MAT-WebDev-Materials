        I liked the loinette, which we can wear as a full-value top during the
        hot season, and in the cold season we can put a jacket on top of it.
        From year to year it remains a trend and a base in the closet.

        I really love these shoes in the 70's style and something reminiscent of
        ballet shoes. You can wear them with almost any look, whether it's
        romantic or casual

          Favorite serial of the month is Bridgerton. From the acting to the
          details in the character.
